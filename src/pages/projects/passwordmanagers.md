# Title 

I design 2 distinct pasword manager prototypes which adhear to the direct manipulation and command language interaction styles respectively. I looked to the Brutalist architecttural style and Stobert and Biddle's study \"The Password Life Cycle: User Behaviour in Managing Passwords\" \[cite\]

In the end, adhering so strictly to a particular feeling for an interface is sure to limit both its utility to users and its ability to appeal to large audiences. Nonetheless, it is important to engage in these sorts of exploration exercises to push up against boundaries of different design styles and philosophies as well as recognize styles that may have gone overlooked in domains. Without forcing yourself to find creative uses of a particular interaction style, you may miss out on some of the most interesting applications of its strengths and may never realize its most devastating weaknesses. 

The direct manipulation interface seems to triumph when exploring the stored account and the command language interface seems more adept at providing a simple, reusable password generator. When deciding on an interaction style, I will be sure to tailor my selection to each particular task rather than force all the functionality to fit under a single style.
