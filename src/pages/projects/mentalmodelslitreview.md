One explanation of human computer interaction (HCI) is that it centers around the communication between designers and users. In this metaphor, technology is the medium through which they communicate. This is true of many mediums; for example, filmmakers articulate themes and ideas to audiences through the visual language of film. The word ‘interaction’ highlights that users must go beyond merely absorbing the information presented to them; to be a user demands a degree of action. Any action is based on a set of assumptions about a situation. When discussing HCI those assumptions are part of a user’s mental models. Firstly, in this context, model refers to a particular understanding of something. For example, the heliocentric model of our solar system suggests that all the planets revolve around the sun whereas a geocentric model claims that the planets orbit the Earth. Mental models are a framework for discussing people’s unique perceptions and is a popular concept in HCI. 

In this paper, I explore the creation of mental models related to security and privacy, where user’s actions or inactions carry profound risks. Unfortunately, the available literature is heavily skewed towards security in this regard but there is some information worth mentioning in terms of privacy and surveillance. Norman specifically states that mental models are naturally formulated as users interact with a system \cite{norman_observations_1983}. When it comes to security issues, such as hacking, some users may fortunately have little to no personal experience and therefore need to seek out external sources to inform the mental models that guide their understanding and behaviour.
