Eye-OS is a mock operating system that leverages eye-gazing as a primary interaction method. This proof of concept focuses on video playing as a high-level goal, and explores ways in which video playingâ€™s sub-tasks can be optimized for this new interaction. The three main aspects to the mock-up are a file manager, a video player, and a calibrator. These components enhance the experience of using eye-gazing and, although built within the context of a video player, can be applied to more general eye-gaze-input systems as well.

The core goal of this project is to create a system designed for eye-gazing. Like other uncommon interaction-models (speech input, VR, etc.), eye-tracking has a lot of downsides that have limited its use in the real world. To remedy these problems, we first identified what the main ones were: inaccuracy of tracking, perception & interaction interference, and stress of using a new form of interaction.
